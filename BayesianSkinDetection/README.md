Brief Overview:

In this project me and my partner Ash Ladouceur were tasked with adding code implementing Maximum Likelihood Estimation for use with our implementation of a Bayesian classifier from the previous project. For part 1, using the generated Gaussian distributions from the previous project, we tested the accuracy of the classifier using the mu and sigma generated using maximum likelihood estimation. For part 2 the same procedure was followed with fewer data points used for maximum likelihood estimation to test the effect of a smaller training set on the results. Part 3 tasked us with using our classifier to classify pixels as skin or not skin. Using the assumption that skin with normalized luminance follows a Gaussian distribution, we used maximum likelihood estimation to find the sample mean and covariance for our training images skin pixels. We then ran the Bayesian classifier on our test images and generated a ROC curve to find the optimal threshold to balance false negatives and false positives. Much more detail on our results are given in "PA2-Report". The implementation details in the report describe our code and how it works. The assignment description shows what we were given as an initial task by our professor Dr. Bebis.
