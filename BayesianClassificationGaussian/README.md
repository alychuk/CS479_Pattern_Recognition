Brief Overview:

In this project me and my partner Ash Ladouceur were tasked with creating a Bayesian classifier. We then, using the boxmuller.cpp code provided to us, generated multiple gaussian distributions and tested our classifier on it. Different "cases" are simplifications of the discriminant function based on different assumptions (for example assuming statistical independence and equal variances for case 1). The effect of these simplifications on classification performance when our assumptions are incorrect, as well as general classification performance are shown in "PA1-Report". The implementation details in the report describe our code and how it works. The assignment description shows what we were given as an initial task by our professor Dr. Bebis.
