# Brief Overview:
In this project me and my partner Ash Ladouceur were tasked with implementing Maximum Likelihood Estimation for use with the Bayesian Classifier we created in the previous project. Experiments showing the performance using ML with varying amounts of training data were performed. We were also tasked with implementing skin detection using Bayesian Classification and ML. The methodology is described in the paper by J. Yang and A. Waibel, "'A Real-time Face Tracker', Proceedings of WACV'96, 1996". Our implementation uses OpenCV for image I/O, but notably, due to restrictions by our professor, does not use any OpenCV functions for classification or color space conversion. We were given training images for the experiments by our professor, which he sourced from the above paper. The implementation details in the report describe our code and how it works. The assignment description shows what we were given as an initial task by our professor Dr. Bebis.
