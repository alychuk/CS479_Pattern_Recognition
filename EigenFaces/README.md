Brief Overview:

In this project me and my partner Ash Ladouceur were tasked with implementing the “EigenFace” method for facial recognition and basic verification described in the paper by M. Turk and A. Pentland “‘Eigenfaces for Recognition’, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 71-86, 1991”. Our implementation uses OpenCV for image I/O, SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and matrix operations, but notably, due to restrictions by our professor, does not use any of OpenCV’s functions for PCA (Principal Component Analysis). We were given normalized facial data for the experiments by our professor, which he sourced from the FERET database. The implementation details in the report describe our code and how it works. The assignment description shows what we were given as an initial task by our professor Dr. Bebis.
